                   <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                   <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>
                   <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25-1.8 metres, weights between 100–270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the Western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild.</p>
                   <p>Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations.</p>
                   <p>Wild male gorillas weigh 136 to 227 kg, while adult females weigh 68–113 kg .Adult males are 1.4 to 1.8 m tall, with an arm span that stretches from 2.3 to 2.6 m. Female gorillas are shorter at 1.25 to 1.5 m (4 ft 1 in to 4 ft 11 in), with smaller arm spans.Colin Groves (1970) calculated the average weight of 42 wild adult male gorillas at 144 kg, while Smith and Jungers (1997) found the average weight of 19 wild adult male gorillas to be 169 kg.Adult male gorillas are known as silverbacks due to the characteristic silver hair on their backs reaching to the hips. The tallest gorilla recorded was a 1.95 m silverback with an arm span of 2.7 m, a chest of 1.98 m , and a weight of 219 kg, shot in Alimbongo, northern Kivu in May 1938.[24] The heaviest gorilla recorded was a 1.83 m silverback shot in Ambam, Cameroon, which weighed 267 kg.Males in captivity can be overweight and reach weights up to 310 kg.</p>
                   <p>Gorillas construct nests for daytime and night use. Nests tend to be simple aggregations of branches and leaves about 0.61 to 1.52 m in diameter and are constructed by individuals. Gorillas, unlike chimpanzees or orangutans, tend to sleep in nests on the ground. The young nest with their mothers, but construct nests after three years of age, initially close to those of their mothers</p>
                   <p>A gorilla's day is divided between rest periods and travel or feeding periods. Diets differ between and within species. Mountain gorillas mostly eat foliage, such as leaves, stems, pith, and shoots, while fruit makes up a very small part of their diets.[39] Mountain gorilla food is widely distributed and neither individuals nor groups have to compete with one another.</p>
