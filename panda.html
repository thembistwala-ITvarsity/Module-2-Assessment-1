                   <h3>PANDA</h3>
                   <p>The giant panda also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda), is a bear native to South Central China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body.</p>
                   <p>The giant panda has luxuriant black-and-white fur. Adults measure around 1.2 to 1.9 metres long, including a tail of about 10–15 cm  and 60 to 90 cm tall at the shoulder. Males can weigh up to 160 kg.Females (generally 10–20% smaller than males) can weigh as little as 70 kg, but can also weigh up to 125 kg. The average weight for adults is 100 to 115 kg </p>
                   <p>Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting almost exclusively of bamboo. However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes, and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut</p>
                   <p>The giant panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountains and in the hilly province of Sichuan. Giant pandas are generally solitary. Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather. After mating, the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub.</p>
